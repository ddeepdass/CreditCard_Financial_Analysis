• Designed and developed a comprehensive, interactive financial dashboard using Power BI, leveraging transaction and customer data sourced from a SQL database to deliver real-time insights into credit card usage patterns, revenue streams, and customer behavior.

• Implemented data extraction and transformation (ETL) processes to clean, merge, and structure large datasets, ensuring accuracy and consistency across all visualizations.

• Monitored key performance indicators (KPIs) such as monthly transaction volume, average spend per customer, delinquency rates, credit limit utilization, and customer segmentation metrics to identify trends and anomalies.

• Incorporated advanced Power BI features such as slicers, drill-through filters, dynamic tooltips, and DAX functions to enhance user interactivity and data exploration capabilities.

• Enabled real-time data refresh and automated reporting to ensure stakeholders always had access to the most up-to-date information.

• Collaborated with business and finance teams to tailor the dashboard design to meet executive and operational needs, ultimately supporting data-driven decision-making related to credit policy, customer retention, and risk management.

• Presented key insights through clear and intuitive visualizations, helping stakeholders quickly identify areas of opportunity and concern, such as underperforming customer segments or rising default rates.
